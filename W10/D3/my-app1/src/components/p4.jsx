// Synthetic event vs Native DOM events

// Synthetic event:
// A wrapper created by React around the browser's native event
// Gives a consistent API across browsers
// works similarly to native DOM events
// Still allows access to the original browser events via
// event.nativeEvent

// Why does React use it?
// To make event handling behave consistently
// To simplify cross-browser differences
// To integrate smoothly with React's event system

// How Synthetic event works:
// Component renders: 
    //  A button appears on the screen
    // handleClick is defined but it is not executed

// User Clicks the button:
    // Browser creates a native click event
    // React wraps that native event in a SyntheticEvent
    // React passes the SyntheticEvent to handleClick

    // event refers to the SyntheticEvent
    // event.target gives us the HTML elements
